# Churn Customer Prediction Using LogReg KNN
Churn customer prediction using logistic regression and KNN

## Overview
Customer churn is the loss of clients or customers. In order to avoid losing customers, a company needs to examine why its customers have left in the past and which features are more important to determine who will churn in the future. Our task is therefore to predict whether customers are about to churn and which are the most important features to get that prediction right. As in most prediction problems, we will use machine learning. This repository contains 2 model, Logistic Regression and KNN.
